DOWN THE LINE CODE:
    [ ] use redis for database
    [ ] finish converting entire frontend to react
    [ ] simplify socket.io to send over state object each time
    [ ] bomb pots

FRONTEND:
    [ ] have messages appear under players name for a few seconds
    [ ] have num hands won logged as badge
    [ ] increase time after hand ends to 2 seconds

DISTINGUISHING FEATURES FROM COMPETITORS:
    [*] have a page where users can see total buyins, automatically updated
    [ ] straddles (double straddle, etc)
    [ ] bomb pots
    [ ] on all ins, show odds of winning (preflop, post flop, turn)
    [ ] ability to run it twice
    [ ] stores messages if you refresh page
    [ ] ability to download game log (of just hands you've played in as well)

GAME FEATURES TO ADD:
    [ ] implement tokyo
    [ ] implement the game of games

Bugs:
    [ ] on refresh players who folded appear to be back in / cards are faceup (general errors all around)
    [ ] players who are waitng have premoves
    [ ] if a player starts a game, the game ends, he quits and then buys back for a different stack amount he shows up with stack he ended with
    [ ] if player joins game when sitting in next round issues
    [ ] infinite for loop somewhere in the code for sure 
        [ ] if a player busts and game can still continue the game freezes

    [ ] With stand up:
        [ ] When the host initially joins the game, both "stand up" and "sit down" buttons are hidden. Refreshing the page fixes this.
            - this is only possible if joinedGame is false in game.ejs.
        [ ] When folding the player when they stand up, call checkwin(). If 1 player remains, call handleEveryoneFolded.
            - We must do this to end the round. Also, we must do this to avoid the case where 0 players remain because all players
                stand up before check_round is called.

    [ ] With premoves
        [ ] if a player premove folds and the player before him folds it will still show a flop


    [ ] number doesnt show occaisonally on a raise
    [ ] all ins can render the winning player before hand finishes
    [ ] raise/bet buttons (1/2 pot, 2x pot, etc) dont yield a value
    [*] raise minus button doesnt yield a value

    [ ] when game ends:
        [ ] remove yellow glow from player who won hand
        [ ] have all the players say waiting
    
    [ ] straddle:
        [ ] if straddling is multi straddle, allow ability for user to just straddle UTG


    Down the line bugs needing to be fixed:
    With refresh:
        [ ] if somebody checked and I refresh the page, the 'check chip' shouldn't be removed from on the table

    Front end/style:
        [ ] the max bet should be the largest stack still in the hand thats not your own
