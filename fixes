ranked in level of severity

Bugs needing to be fixed before launch:
    [ ] With show hand:
        [*] if a game ends (player busts for example) and I start a new game, the 'show hand' aciton is the only action
        [ ] when a player calls an all-in and they start to race the action buttons should be removed
        [ ] when an all in "runout" is occuring there should not be the show hand feature

    [ ] With premoves
        [ ] if a player premove folds and the player before him folds it will still show a flop

    [ ] With handrankmessage:
        [ ] on all ins the handrankmessage doesnt appear
        [ ] on all ins the handrankmessage doesnt update for user
        [ ] handrankmessage stays if game ends bc of all in

    [ ] number doesnt show occaisonally on a raise
    [ ] all ins can render the winning player before hand finishes
    [ ] raise/bet buttons (1/2 pot, 2x pot, etc) dont yield a value
    [*] raise minus button doesnt yield a value

Features needed to be added before launch:
    [ ] host page
        [ ] adjust blinds
        [ ] remove player
        [ ] update player stack
    [ ] player stand up
    [ ] straddle front end
    [ ] move game log from chatroom to game log 

Down the line bugs needing to be fixed:
    With refresh:
        [ ] if somebody checked and I refresh the page, the 'check chip' shouldn't be removed from on the table

    Front end/style:
        [ ] the max bet should be the largest stack still in the hand thats not your own
